# Sample Vuejs Challenge ðŸ˜‹

### What?

This is a sample [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) application in which a user can search city weather information by its name.

The weather theme was inspired by [frontend-challenges](https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges).


### Why?

This is intended to serve as a quick display of my skills to recruiters.

### How?

This project uses [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/).

In order to run the project, just add a **VUE_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY** environment variable with your api key to the project and run:

```
yarn start
```

Check the [LIVE](https://weather-browser-vuejs.vercel.app/) version ðŸ˜Ž;

### P.S

This app **BY NO MEANS** should be taken as a final solution.
